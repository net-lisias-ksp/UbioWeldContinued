# Welding Ltd. Continuum :: Change Log

* 2019-0525: 2.6.0.5 (Lisias) for 1.4.1 <= KSP <= 1.4.5
	+ After almost a Year, Continuum goes gold! :-)
		- Finally fully supporting KSP 1.4.5... =P
		- KSP >= 1.5 depends on implementing proper support for `ModulePartVariant`, something that will be tricky to say the least.
	+ Using KSPe Facilities (hard dependency):
		- File facilities (user configurable files are not on <KSP_ROOT>/PluginData)
		- UI facilities (transparent proxy to ClickTroughBlocker)
		- Log facilities
	+ Bug fixes
		- Toolbar registering fix
		- Log level select now works
		- Preventing empty `.cfg` files to be created 
* 2018-0608: 2.6.0.4 (Lisias) for KSP 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
	+ KSP 1.4.1 Part IV
	+ Added Hard Dependency: ClickThroughBlocker
	+ Better Exception handling while loading configurations
		- They are created automatically now
	+ Some code maintainabiity improvements
	+ Reworking MiniAVC support.
	+ PRE RELEASE: Not properly tested.
* 2018-0410: 2.6.0.3 (Lisias) for KSP 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Trying again to Support KSP 1.4.1 - part III
	+ Solving a problem on the Toolbar, that was raising an exception internally on the game and preventing all the toolbar buttons (not just mine) to show when coming back to the Editor once a ship is launched.
	+ Getting rid of unused config options.
	+ Refactoring the Plug-In's life cycle code to better cope with nowadays KSP versions.
* 2018-0408: 2.6.0.2 (Lisias) for KSP 1.4.1 PRE-RELEASE
